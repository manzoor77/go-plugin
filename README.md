# go-plugin
build a math plugin that performs multiple mathematical operations. It start by creating a package main that performs basic mathematical operations viz, addition and subtraction. 

build the Go plugin using the command:

```go build -buildmode=plugin -o math.so```

Above command uses the buildmode=plugin that suggests the Go compiler to compile the code in plugin mode and not as a package or a command binary.
math.so is the shared library or the plugin generated by Go compiler. You could choose to store the built plugin anywhere on your file system (generally recommended to have a plugins folder).

##### Loading the Plugin:
The only thing that you require to know before loading the plugin is itâ€™s location. It is recommended that all plugins are built and stored in plugins folder. So this problem solves itself. But you could also choose to pass the plugin path as command line argument or environment variable based on how you see your program being used.


use the filepath.Glob() function from path/filepath package to get the plugin based on the location on file system. And the plugin package has Open() function that is leveraged to load the plugin.
